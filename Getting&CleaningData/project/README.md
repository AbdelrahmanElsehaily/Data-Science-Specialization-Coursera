# Gettin and cleaning Data Project
This repo is my own project of Getting and Cleaning Data Course on Coursera which cleans data of Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones form UCI Machine learning Repository and create a new tidy data set
source of the data  set[http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones#](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones#)
## The script (run_analysis.R)
The script read all the needed files from the data set folder combining the training and testing sets together the extract the need features from them and finally write the resulted tidy data into a file.

## The Code Book(CodeBook.md)
 describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data
